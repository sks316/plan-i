## ru ni
I'm a 22 y/o tech enthusiast from the uk. I've been helping run the discord server for a somewhat prominent indie game studio since the company was just a guy watching tutorials. The server is at 36k users right now so the last few years have been quite the experience dealing with communities of various sizes as they grow.   But there's also other servers like the me_irl one that i've found myself connected with as I've known the previous 'owner' of the server from the gamedev server for a year or two before and have been operating it since the transfer of ownership a little while ago. I'm not sure what impression you've got of the server but I'd be interested to hear what it is and what could have left that impression on you.

Hi! I'm a music major who spends free time playing video games. I'm often on discord and I enjoy being a part of small communities. I want to do what I can to help Pika.

## Master9000
Hello there, I'm a computer enthusiast that likes [spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17HwmmJE-oKMyD20SwOqGjQN9XXTj0SU7nXy-oKQ5zFw/edit?usp=sharing), video games, and adding to the list of discord servers I'm rarely ever seen on. Pika's isn't among those and I am looking forward to helping him when possible.

## Killer Queenstar
I'm Killer Queenstar. I'm also a teenager who is interested in programming, and I love graphic design, linguistics, watching anime (japanese TV), and playing video games. I'm learning a lot of skills at the moment, reading a lot of books, and having a lot of fun playing with my friends. We all miss Pika, and hope that he can return to the discord.

## SCOTT0852 (aka Local Nintendo Hacker)
I'm a student who spends a decent amount of time playing video games and hacking consoles (current list: Wii U, 3DS, PS Vita, and Switch). Personally, I think Pika really added something to the conversations we had on Discord & would love to see him back. That pika.py bot he made looks pretty neat too, it's more complex than a few other bots I've seen (and I'm in maybe 30 or 40 different Discord servers!)
