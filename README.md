## ru ni
I'm a 22 y/o tech enthusiast from the uk. I've been helping run the discord server for a somewhat prominent indie game studio since the company was just a guy watching tutorials. The server is at 36k users right now so the last few years have been quite the experience dealing with communities of various sizes as they grow.   But there's also other servers like the me_irl one that i've found myself connected with as I've known the previous 'owner' of the server from the gamedev server for a year or two before and have been operating it since the transfer of ownership a little while ago. I'm not sure what impression you've got of the server but I'd be interested to hear what it is and what could have left that impression on you.

Hi! I'm a music major who spends free time playing video games. I'm often on discord and I enjoy being a part of small communities. I want to do what I can to help Pika.

## Master9000
Hello there, I'm a computer enthusiast that likes [spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17HwmmJE-oKMyD20SwOqGjQN9XXTj0SU7nXy-oKQ5zFw/edit?usp=sharing), video games, and adding to the list of discord servers I'm rarely ever seen on. Pika's isn't among those and I am looking forward to helping him when possible.

## Killer Queenstar
I'm Killer Queenstar. I'm also a teenager who is interested in programming, and I love graphic design, linguistics, watching anime (japanese TV), and playing video games. I'm learning a lot of skills at the moment, reading a lot of books, and having a lot of fun playing with my friends. We all miss Pika, and hope that he can return to the discord.

## SCOTT0852 (aka Local Nintendo Hacker)
I'm a student who spends a decent amount of time playing video games and hacking consoles (current list: Wii U, 3DS, PS Vita, and Switch). Personally, I think Pika really added something to the conversations we had on Discord & would love to see him back. That pika.py bot he made looks pretty neat too, it's more complex than a few other bots I've seen (and I'm in maybe 30 or 40 different Discord servers!)

## PVdude
I'm a teenager who likes to hack consoles and generally mess around with computers. I currently know multiple programming lanaguages such as C++, Java, Python, Javascript, and Kotlin. I love to hack consoles, play games, and make games. I feel Pika should be added back as he has shown to be nice very helpful to all the Discord servers i've seen him on.

## Snoot
Hi! I'm a student interested with programming. I've been enjoying building up my security and server expertise, in addition to working on reverse engineering products. In my spare time, you'll often catch me reading, listening to music or just hanging out with friends.

I've only known Pika for shorter than people above probably have but have had some good conversations about programming, including one of my favorite languages, Go. It's my hope you'll let them continue to be with all the cool developer people above on Discord.

The internet is a very interesting place. So many different people, from so many different places! Ideas from all over, by people not too dissimilar from you and me. It is one of humanity's greatest achievements! But, like many things that are good, they can be used for evil. How much of it is truly bad though, in comparison to what is good? Compare the internet to a plant - growing nice and strong. But then, a part of it dies. This is inevitable. But to say the entire plant is bad just because one part of it is dead? What gardener would do that? You should instead cut off the dead part, which not only removes the bad but in turn strengthens the good.
While it may seem like Discord is bad, it is best compared to this plant. Sure, it will have times where it can be bad, but you can say that for just about anything. The community that we're building is meant to be a positive one; one driven by a love of friendship, games, and software engineering. Even though I may not know Pika personally, I believe that everyone should be given a chance to be apart of this community. Those who wish to ruin it, lose such a privilege. Pika has been nothing but a blessing to this community, and it would be such a shame for them to be removed.
But why should you listen to me? I don't know. Thats the tough part. If there was any reasonable way to prove my legitimacy, I would in a heartbeat. I'm just like many of the other people who have contributed here. Just someone who really enjoys anything to do with technology (and Mario Kart :P). If you were to take anything from this little spiel, I wish that you would realize that Pika is well loved in this community, and they deserve to be here.

## Austin (sks316)
Hey, I'm Austin, though most people online know me by the name of sks316. I'm a 15 y/o who likes to spend his free time playing video games and interacting with the many friends I have made through Discord, one of which is Pika. I initially discovered Pika when his bot, Pika.py, was added to a server created by a friend of mine. Since then, I feel like Pika has become a very good friend of mine, and as we all know, friends are one of the things in life that are irreplaceable. I may just be a random internet stranger, but I care about Pika, as do many others.
